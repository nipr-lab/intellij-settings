# IntelliJ Config Project

## How To: Export Settings
1. Delete contents of `config` directory if left over from a previous run
2. Start IntelliJ with a clean config: `./launch-custom.sh <path to IntelliJ install>`
    * Explanation: runs an isolated version of IntelliJ via a customized `idea.properties`. If you don't have bash available, 
    it's easy enough to do by hand. Look at the script and refer to this doc to understand how the config works:
    https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tuning-intellij-idea.html#configure-platform-properties  
3. Import previous `settings.jar`: welcome screen -> configure -> import settings
4. Restart IntelliJ to apply settings
5. Install plugins: wait for green notification bubble next to "Events", click it to update
6. Restart IntelliJ to apply plugins
7. Modify settings as desired
8. Export new settings: welcome screen -> configure -> export settings.

**IMPORTANT:** Pay attention to what settings you export to avoid overriding everyone's personal customizations.
Especially do not export "DefaultFont", "Look and Feel", or other UI-related settings. If you aren't sure what is being 
exported, try looking at the `settings.jar` (which contains human-readable config files). 

## How To: Import Settings
### One time setup
1. Prerequisite: Check out `common-build`. If you already have it checked out, **make sure it is updated**.
    * **Important**: If checked out somewhere other than `C:/Data/workspace/eclipse/common-build`, you will need to change your 
    IntelliJ settings for Checkstyle and Eclipse Code Formatter plugins after finishing the rest of this guide.
2. Download and install IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate
    * Link: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
    * If shown a Windows/RSA authentication popup, try entering your credentials. If it fails, click "No" and the installer 
    should open anyways. If it still doesn't open, ask for help.  
    * Install location: Doesn't matter; the default is fine.
    * Install options: Make sure to select the checkbox to include JetBrain's bundled JRE. Also, it is recommend to select the
    64-bit launcher desktop shortcut and create associations for all file types.
3. Open IntelliJ
    1. When shown a "Complete Installation" dialog asking where to import Intellij IDEA settings from, choose do not import 
    settings (this is used to migrate from an old version if you had it installed previously).
    2. You will be presented with a series of customization options. Feel free to pick a theme of your choice. On the next 
    screen regarding customizing plugins, you can accept the defaults as-is.
    3. Once finished, you will finally be shown a welcome splash screen with the logo and a handful of options (Create New 
    Project, etc).
4. Import NIPR settings
    1. Download `settings.jar` from this repo
    2. On the welcome splash screen, go to Configure (at the bottom right) -> Import Settings
    3. Select the settings jar
    4. Make sure all categories are selected (the default) and confirm
5. Restart IntelliJ to apply settings (the IDE should display a notification prompting you to do this)
6. A green notification bubble should appear prompting you to update/install plugins. Accept this and restart again when prompted.

### Each time you check out an Ant/Ivy project
*Note:* These steps will be unnecessary for Gradle-based projects due to much better IntelliJ integration.

1. Verify project structure: File -> Project Structure or `ctrl-alt-shift-s`
    1. Project Settings -> Project: Make sure "Project SDK" and "Project Language Level" are correct (presumably Java 8)
    2. If "Problems" section shows any issues, resolve them. Projects with Eclipse's `.classpath` file will frequently have 
    extraneous modules related to Ivy and/or TestNG that IntelliJ misinterprets. The broken ones (shown in red) can be safely 
    removed. 
2. Ivy config: settings file
    1. Open project settings: File -> Settings or `ctrl-alt-s`
    2. Go to Other Settings -> IvyIDEA
    3. Under "Ivy Settings" at the top, click "Choose Your Own" and select `ivysettings-windows.xml` from your `common-build` 
    directory.
3. Resolve/refresh Ivy dependencies: right click on project's root folder -> IvyIDEA -> Resolve for all modules

## Notes/Tips
* Do **not** check IntelliJ IDE files (`.idea` directory, `*.iml` and `*.eml` files) into version control.
